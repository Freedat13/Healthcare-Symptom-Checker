# üè• Healthcare Symptom Checker (LLM-Powered)

This project implements a web-based Healthcare Symptom Checker, fulfilling the assignment objective of creating an application that takes symptom text input and outputs probable conditions and recommended next steps using a Large Language Model (LLM) for dynamic reasoning.

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary goal is to demonstrate the integration of an LLM as a backend API service to provide educational, non-diagnostic health information based on user-provided symptoms. The system prioritizes **safety, correctness, and high-quality LLM reasoning**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic LLM Analysis:** Uses the **Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for sophisticated, context-aware analysis of symptom text, providing unique responses for every input.
* **Structured Output:** The Python backend uses the Gemini API's **JSON Schema** capability to ensure the LLM output is consistently structured (`probable_conditions`, `recommended_next_steps`), making it easy for the frontend to parse and display.
* **Safety Focus:** Includes a prominent, LLM-generated **safety disclaimer** in every response, emphasizing that the output is for educational purposes only.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** Clean separation between the Python Flask backend (API) and the HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
* **LLM Reasoning Trace:** Displays a note on the LLM's reasoning quality/complexity for evaluation.

## üíª Technical Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend API** | Python 3, **Flask**, `flask-cors` | Handles API requests, communicates with the LLM, and structures data. |
| **LLM Service** | **Google Gemini API** (`google-genai` SDK) | Provides the core intelligence, reasoning, and suggestion generation. |
| **Frontend Structure** | HTML5 (`index.html`) | Defines the user interface and input/output fields. |
| **Frontend Logic** | JavaScript (`script.js`) | Handles user interaction, makes `fetch` calls to the Python API, and updates the DOM. |
| **Styling** | CSS3 (`style.css`) | Provides clean, modern styling for usability. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Project Structure

Ensure your project directory contains these four files:

symptom_checker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py          # Python Backend (Flask + Gemini API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # HTML Frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css       # CSS Styling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # JavaScript Logic


### 2. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and install the required Python libraries:

pip install Flask Flask-CORS google-genai

### 3. Configure API Key (CRUCIAL STEP)
The Python backend securely loads your API key from the environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY. You must set this variable before running app.py.

Operating System	Command to Set Key
Linux/macOS	export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
Windows (PowerShell)	$env:GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

(Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key from Google AI Studio's Created API.)

ex: $env:GEMINI_API_KEY='AIzaSyDlmv7H8TTwu8Kqo7Fi9P5xfmx0iw329RX'

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution
1. Run the Python Backend (Terminal 1)
Open your first terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and start the Flask server. This runs your API on port 5000.

python app.py
Keep this terminal window open and running.

2. Run the HTML Frontend (Browser)
Open the index.html file in your web browser. 

start index.html (or)

This can usually be done by double-clicking the file in your file explorer.

3. Test the Application
Enter your symptoms (e.g., "Sharp headache behind the eyes and sensitivity to light").

Click the "Check Symptoms" button.


The JavaScript will send the request to the running Python API, the LLM will generate a structured response, and the results will populate the lists on the web page.
